Full stack php web application that requires a login to perform CRUD operations. Database download is currently broken on phpmyadmin so that is not included. I will probably at a later time fix this issue at the next release of phpmypadmin or by recreating the database. The site is also missing css files, I am not sure what happened to those. Login is hardcoded as 'me@example.com' and 'testpass'.
